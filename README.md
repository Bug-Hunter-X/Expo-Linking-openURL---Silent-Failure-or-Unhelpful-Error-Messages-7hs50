# Expo Linking.openURL() Issues

This repository demonstrates a common problem encountered when using the Expo `Linking.openURL()` API:  silent failures or vague error messages when attempting to open invalid or inaccessible URLs.  The lack of detailed error handling in the `Linking` API makes debugging challenging.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic behavior. The `bugSolution.js` file offers a more robust solution.

## Problem

The core issue is that `Linking.openURL()` may not always throw an error, even when the URL is invalid or the app cannot access it. This often leads to silent failures, making it difficult to identify and resolve the problem.

## Solution

The solution involves adding more comprehensive error handling.  Instead of relying solely on the success or failure of `Linking.openURL()`, the improved approach uses `try...catch` blocks and provides more informative feedback to the user.
